REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
- Good graphics card. (GeForce class for decent performance)
  It starts in software mode also, with lots of features disabled.
- 300+ MHz CPU
- 64 Mb mem

Reaper makes heavy use of OpenGL, so good drivers are a must.


Following graphics systems have been confirmed to work
- Nvidia (TNT, TNT2, GeForce,  GeForce 2 MX, GeForce 2)
- Microsoft Software Implementation
- Mesa
- Sun Ultra60 (Creator/Elite 3d)

Presently, we have unresolved issues with Matrox cards.



BUGREPORTING:
------------

If you experience problems or crashes, please doublecheck your
graphics settings and drivers before reporting problems.
However, if you have problems which you cannot derive from
misconfiguration or bad drivers, then please submit a 
detailed bugreport so we can fix it.

If reaper crashes seemingly randomly, it may help to turn off
sound and/or various graphics features.
