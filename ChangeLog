Version 0.98.2 - ?
 * Cleanup of shadow system (could be even better)
 * BUGFIX: Incorrect handling of textures larger than GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE
 * Removed glsdk from src/ext-directory (not used)
 * Added glh (gl helper library)
 * Added nvparse (nvidia parser library)
 * Add extgen (gl extension definition file generator)
 * Changed OpenGL extensions handling from homegrown to glh/extgen
 * Dynamic environment mapping on the player's ship
 * The autoconf setup is a bit less hackish
 * Added GL-headers in src/GL - eliminates the need to adapt
    to broken headers on various systems.
 * Fixed a time leak in the mainloop
 * Improved network-startup, better synchronization
 * Compiles cleanly with gcc and
    -ansi -pedantic -Wall -W -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-unused
 * Changed use_texture to an int (texture_level), allowing 
    a textured hud while object textures are turned off.


Version 0.98.1 - 2002-05-04

 * The gfx/physics/world/network-subsystems have been improved.

 * Compiles with gcc versions prior to 3, without STLport.


Version 0.98 - 2002-03-31

 * Preloading of textures and objects should minimise
   freezes during gameplay.

 * A few objects added to the scenario.

 * configure should detect more variations of GL-headers, 
   and generally work a bit better, flags changed a bit,
   see INSTALL


Version 0.97 - 2002-03-11

 * Sheeps!
 * autoconf based building and installation (build/ac)
 * major cvs-tree-cleanup:
    doc/ cleanup
    data/ cleanup
     (A new cvs-module, reaper-content, contains everything related
      to content-creation, and reaper/data should only contains
      files needed to run the game)
    Windows support libraries are now distributed separately
     (http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/reaper/dist/win32-support.zip)
    spmake is moved to another cvs-tree
     (zarquon.hemmet.chalmers.se:/usr/share/cvsroot spmake)
 * changed commandline arguments to:
     -h       help
     -f       skip menu and go directly to game
     -g       print all debug messages on stdout
     -r <dir> use alternate reaper-root directory
     -d <dir> use alternate data directory
     -p <dir> use alternate plugin directory
     module:variable=value    set a config-variable


Version 0.96 - 2002-02-26

 * Split-screen mode
